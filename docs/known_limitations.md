## Known limitations

- There are still a number of missing good-to-have features, for workflow design. See the [issues](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues) tracker for details.
- There is not yet support for the [Common Workflow Language](http://common-workflow-language.github.io), but that is also something that we plan to support in the future.

At the time of writing this, the recommended way to split files is to use the
[`FileSplitter` component](https://godoc.org/github.com/scipipe/scipipe/components#FileSplitter)
in the [component library](https://godoc.org/github.com/scipipe/scipipe/components) shipped with SciPipe.

There is also [an example which uses it](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/blob/master/examples/scatter_gather/scattergather.go#L24) available.
